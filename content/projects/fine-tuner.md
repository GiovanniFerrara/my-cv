- End-to-end toolkit that parses WhatsApp exports, builds OpenAI-ready JSONL datasets, and triggers fine-tune jobs through a Node.js CLI.
- Ships a React chat interface where you pick the speaker roles, plug in the fine-tuned model ID, and role-play conversations in a WhatsApp-styled UI.
- Includes setup scripts, environment management, and privacy-first defaults so data only ever leaves the machine when hitting OpenAI APIs.
