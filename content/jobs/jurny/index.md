- Architected Nia, a multi-agent platform powered by OpenAI and Claude models orchestrating reservation workflows end to end; now resolves ~80% of guest requests autonomously, cuts resolution time from hours to minutes, and I lead a squad of 4 engineers across AI and product.
- Previously frontend lead for a team of 5 developers, defining the Frontend architecture with React/TypeScript and React Query.
- Helping to implement an AI-first culture across product, ops, and support by codifying our practices in a internal AI knowledge base, auto-recording and analyzing meetings for action items, and turning "invisible" onboarding calls transcriptions into automations that keep humans focused on the highest-leverage work.
